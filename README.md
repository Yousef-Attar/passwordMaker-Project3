# 🔐 PasswordMaker – Random Password Generator

This is **Project 3** in my Scrimba Full Stack Career Path. It’s a secure, stylish random password generator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, offering both functionality and visual feedback.

> ⚠️ I built this project **entirely by myself from scratch** without help from anyone. Every line of code — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — is my own work.
